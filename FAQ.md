## Project name
BOBC

## Tagline
Overcollateralized BOB Stablecoin backed by ETH

## Why am I participating in Based LatAm?
I want to connect with like-minded individuals in LatAm; I believe that is very important for us as a community to connect and grow together. Participating in the hackathon was a way for me to show my skills and share my knowledge, hopefully a good presentation card for future endeavors.

## What challenges am I focusing on?
Stablecoin adoption in Bolivia is reaching sky-high levels (cryptocurrency adoption alone has grown 100% in the last 3 months). I want to create an algorithimic decentralized stablecoin pegged to the bolivian boliviano (BOB) to spark interest in potential usecases for crypto here in my home country.

## How does my submission address this challenge?
I created a decentralized algothimic stablecoin backed by ultrasound money (ETH). This removes any intermediary between the stablecoin and the user since the price is mantained by an algorithm and market makers, empowering all protocol participants in an open and trustless manner.

With more work, this could sprak interest in cryptocurrencies for day-to-day operations, like simple commerce and shopping.

## Challenges I ran into
Creating a good decentralized application involves multiple steps. The first was creating a protocol entirely from scratch (using Vyper) that allowed the stablecoin to exist. This was the most challenging part because I hadn't done something like this in the past, and it was a ton of fun!

The next step was creating a good, user-friendly, and intuitive blockchain application that anyone with some basic understanding of blockchain can use, and, in my opinion, it came out perfect!

## Technologies I used
- Vyper: To create the entire smart contract logic.
- Apeworx: To manage deployments and tests.
- React + Next: The webapp is built from scratch using React.
- Wagmi: To connect the frontend with the smart contracts.
